# ðŸ¥‘ Avocado Ripeness Classification using Machine Learning

This project presents a machine learning-based solution for classifying avocado ripeness stages using image processing. It aims to provide a non-destructive, scalable, and efficient alternative to traditional ripeness assessment methods in the agricultural supply chain.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Accurate ripeness detection is essential for minimizing food waste, optimizing supply chain decisions, and improving consumer satisfaction. Traditional methods like visual inspection and firmness tests are subjective and inefficient. This project combines **image preprocessing techniques** with **machine learning algorithms** to build an **automated avocado ripeness classifier**.
